## Form Action

There is a form action for standalone forms, which lets you save the users UTM tags from the referrer URL.

**The following UTM tags can be recorded using the form action:**
* UTM tags that are being recorded:
* utm_campaign
* utm_content
* utm_medium
* utm_source
* utm_term

## Contact Timeline

Once a contact has submitted a form, which contains the "Record UTM tags" form action, you will be able to see the UTM tags in the timeline of the Contact. Every recorded parameter will be displayed here.

**Note:**
You can also utilize the recorded UTM tags to use them in a campaign as a Condition. Use the Condition "Contact field value" and choose the UTM tag that you want to check on.
